# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The analysis in this project was performed for ride share company PyBer. We were tasked with looking at rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. In order to present the data to PyBer's CEO, we used the Python graphing library Matplotlib, which is a favorite tool among data scientists and data analysts due to the robust visualization features.

## Results

In our analysis we segmented the ride share data into rural, suburban and urban categories. We then compared total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each category. The result of this analysis can be seen in the below dataframe.

After performing our analysis it became clear that the rural segment of the market was being underserved in terms of the number of drivers. This lack of drivers may have resulted in higher fares during peak demand times. It was also clear that there was an oversaturation of drivers in the Urban segment of the market as there were nearly 800 more drivers than actual rides taken. The rural segment also generated the lowest total fares for Pyber which can be seen on the graph below.
