# PyBer Analysis

##Overview
The analysis in this project was performed for ride share company PyBer. We were tasked with looking at rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. In order to present the data to PyBer's CEO, we used the Python graphing library Matplotlib, which is a favorite tool among data scientists and data analysts due to the robust visualization features.

##Results
In our analysis we segmented the ride share data into rural, suburban and urban categories. We then compared total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each category. The result of this analysis can be seen in the below dataframe.
